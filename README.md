# odin-recipies
I will be creating a simple recipe HTML site with 3 dishes that contain a brief description of the recipie, ingredients needed, and the steps to be taken to create the dish.
ordered lists will be used for the steps
unordered lists will be used for the ingredients
also headers and images will be used to spruce the page up
